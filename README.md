# The relationship between Covid-19 and culture is a side-project to quentch my curiosity on which type of culture is better off during the COVID-19 Pandemic. There are two types of cultures
Definitions from google
Individualistic culture
- Individualistic culture is a society which is characterized by individualism, which is the prioritization or emphasis of the individual over the entire group. Individualistic cultures are oriented around the self, being independent instead of identifying with a group mentality.
e.g United States of America, Canada
Collectivist culture
-Collectivism is a value that is characterized by emphasis on cohesiveness among individuals and prioritization of the group over the self.
e.g china, india, philippine 

It all started when I question my Dad on weather or not it is better to sacrifise the individual for the good of the collective durint times of a crisis. In china the government can issue orders to lock down an entire city in the efforts of containing a virus. While in the west such actions would be viewed as a violation of the god given rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. My initial hypothesis is that collectivist cultures would tent to fare better in terms of the pandemic as the individual would be willing to sacrifise their own interests to better the collective. On the contrary in individualistic cultures people would value freedom over sickness which would in turn have higher numbers.
